      label: Reproduction
      description: A link to a repository, or a fork of https://node.new/sveltekit, that reproduces the issue. Reproductions must be [short, self-contained and correct](http://sscce.org/) and must not contain files or code that aren't relevant to the issue â€” please do NOT just paste a link to your project. Explaining how to reproduce is generally not enough. It pushes the burden of creating a reproduction project onto a small set of volunteer maintainers and isn't scalable. If no reproduction is provided, the issue will be closed.

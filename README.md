### Migrating from Sapper

Check out the [Migration Guide](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/migrating) if you are upgrading from Sapper.

## Bug reporting

Please make sure the issue you're reporting involves SvelteKit. Many issues related to how a project builds originate from [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which is used to build a SvelteKit project. It's important to note that new Vite projects don't use SSR by default, and so if you create a new Vite project from scratch, many issues won't reproduce. You should thus start with a project that utilizes SSR, such as `npm create vite-extra@latest -- --template ssr-svelte`.

If an issue originates from Vite, please report in the [Vite issue tracker](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues).

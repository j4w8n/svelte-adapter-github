### Rest parameters

If the number of route segments is unknown, you can use rest syntax — for example you might implement GitHub's file viewer like so...

```bash
/[org]/[repo]/tree/[branch]/[...file]
```

...in which case a request for `/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/documentation/docs/04-advanced-routing.md` would result in the following parameters being available to the page:

```js
// @noErrors
{
	org: 'sveltejs',
	repo: 'kit',
	branch: 'master',
	file: 'documentation/docs/04-advanced-routing.md'
}
```

> `src/routes/a/[...rest]/z/+page.svelte` will match `/a/z` (i.e. there's no parameter at all) as well as `/a/b/z` and `/a/b/c/z` and so on. Make sure you check that the value of the rest parameter is valid, for example using a [matcher](#matching).

#### 404 pages

Rest parameters also allow you to render custom 404s. Given these routes...

```
src/routes/
├ marx-brothers/
│ ├ chico/
│ ├ harpo/
│ ├ groucho/
│ └ +error.svelte
└ +error.svelte
```

...the `marx-brothers/+error.svelte` file will _not_ be rendered if you visit `/marx-brothers/karl`, because no route was matched. If you want to render the nested error page, you should create a route that matches any `/marx-brothers/*` request, and return a 404 from it:

```diff
src/routes/
├ marx-brothers/
+| ├ [...path]/
│ ├ chico/
│ ├ harpo/
│ ├ groucho/
│ └ +error.svelte
└ +error.svelte
```

```js
/// file: src/routes/marx-brothers/[...path]/+page.js
import { error } from '@sveltejs/kit';

/** @type {import('./$types').PageLoad} */
export function load(event) {
	throw error(404, 'Not Found');
}
```

> If you don't handle 404 cases, they will appear in [`handleError`](/docs/hooks#shared-hooks-handleerror)

### Matching

A route like `src/routes/archive/[page]` would match `/archive/3`, but it would also match `/archive/potato`. We don't want that. You can ensure that route parameters are well-formed by adding a _matcher_ — which takes the parameter string (`"3"` or `"potato"`) and returns `true` if it is valid — to your [`params`](/docs/configuration#files) directory...

```js
/// file: src/params/integer.js
/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').ParamMatcher} */
export function match(param) {
	return /^\d+$/.test(param);
}
```

...and augmenting your routes:

```diff
-src/routes/archive/[page]
+src/routes/archive/[page=integer]
```

If the pathname doesn't match, SvelteKit will try to match other routes (using the sort order specified below), before eventually returning a 404.

> Matchers run both on the server and in the browser.

### Sorting

It's possible for multiple routes to match a given path. For example each of these routes would match `/foo-abc`:

```bash
src/routes/[...catchall]/+page.svelte
src/routes/[a]/+server.js
src/routes/[b]/+page.svelte
src/routes/foo-[c]/+page.svelte
src/routes/foo-abc/+page.svelte
```

SvelteKit needs to know which route is being requested. To do so, it sorts them according to the following rules...

- More specific routes are higher priority (e.g. a route with no parameters is more specific than a route with one dynamic parameter, and so on)
- `+server` files have higher priority than `+page` files
- Parameters with [matchers](#matching) (`[name=type]`) are higher priority than those without (`[name]`)
- Rest parameters have lowest priority
- Ties are resolved alphabetically

...resulting in this ordering, meaning that `/foo-abc` will invoke `src/routes/foo-abc/+page.svelte`, and `/foo-def` will invoke `src/routes/foo-[c]/+page.svelte` rather than less specific routes:

```bash
src/routes/foo-abc/+page.svelte
src/routes/foo-[c]/+page.svelte
src/routes/[a]/+server.js
src/routes/[b]/+page.svelte
src/routes/[...catchall]/+page.svelte
```

### Encoding

Directory names are URI-decoded, meaning that (for example) a directory like `%40[username]` would match characters beginning with `@`:

```js
// @filename: ambient.d.ts
declare global {
	const assert: {
		equal: (a: any, b: any) => boolean;
	};
}

export {};

// @filename: index.js
// ---cut---
assert.equal(
	decodeURIComponent('%40[username]'),
	'@[username]'
);
```

To express a `%` character, use `%25`, otherwise the result will be malformed.

### Advanced layouts

By default, the _layout hierarchy_ mirrors the _route hierarchy_. In some cases, that might not be what you want.

#### (group)

Perhaps you have some routes that are 'app' routes that should have one layout (e.g. `/dashboard` or `/item`), and others that are 'marketing' routes that should have a different layout (`/blog` or `/testimonials`). We can group these routes with a directory whose name is wrapped in parentheses — unlike normal directories, `(app)` and `(marketing)` do not affect the URL pathname of the routes inside them:

```diff
src/routes/
+│ (app)/
│ ├ dashboard/
│ ├ item/
│ └ +layout.svelte
+│ (marketing)/
│ ├ about/
│ ├ testimonials/
│ └ +layout.svelte
├ admin/
└ +layout.svelte
```

You can also put a `+page` directly inside a `(group)`, for example if `/` should be an `(app)` or a `(marketing)` page.

Pages and layouts inside groups — as in any other directory — will inherit layouts above them, unless they _break out_ of the layout hierarchy as shown in the next section. In the above example, `(app)/+layout.svelte` and `(marketing)/+layout.svelte` both inherit `+layout.svelte`.

#### +page@

Conversely, some routes of your app might need to break out of the layout hierarchy. Let's add an `/item/[id]/embed` route inside the `(app)` group from the previous example:

```diff
src/routes/
├ (app)/
│ ├ item/
│ │ ├ [id]/
│ │ │ ├ embed/
+│ │ │ │ └ +page.svelte
│ │ │ └ +layout.svelte
│ │ └ +layout.svelte
│ └ +layout.svelte
└ +layout.svelte
```

Ordinarily, this would inherit the root layout, the `(app)` layout, the `item` layout and the `[id]` layout. We can reset to one of those layouts by appending `@` followed by the segment name — or, for the root layout, the empty string. In this example, we can choose from `+page@.svelte`, `+page@(app).svelte`, `+page@item.svelte` or `+page@[id].svelte`:

```diff
src/routes/
├ (app)/
│ ├ item/
│ │ ├ [id]/
│ │ │ ├ embed/
+│ │ │ │ └ +page@(app).svelte
│ │ │ └ +layout.svelte
│ │ └ +layout.svelte
│ └ +layout.svelte
└ +layout.svelte
```

#### +layout@

Like pages, layouts can _themselves_ break out of their parent layout hierarchy, using the same technique. For example, a `+layout@.svelte` component would reset the hierarchy for all its child routes.

#### When to use layout groups

Not all use cases are suited for layout grouping, nor should you feel compelled to use them. It might be that your use case would result in complex `(group)` nesting, or that you don't want to introduce a `(group)` for a single outlier. It's perfectly fine to use other means such as composition (reusable `load` functions or Svelte components) or if-statements to achieve what you want. The following example shows a layout that rewinds to the root layout and reuses components and functions that other layouts can also use:

```svelte
/// file: src/routes/nested/route/+layout@.svelte
<script>
	import ReusableLayout from '$lib/ReusableLayout.svelte';
	export let data;
</script>

<ReusableLayout {data}>
	<slot />
</ReusableLayout>
```

```js
/// file: src/routes/nested/route/+layout.js
// @filename: ambient.d.ts
declare module "$lib/reusable-load-function" {
	export function reusableLoad(event: import('@sveltejs/kit').LoadEvent): Promise<Record<string, any>>;
}
// @filename: index.js
// ---cut---
import { reusableLoad } from '$lib/reusable-load-function';

/** @type {import('./$types').PageLoad} */
export function load(event) {
	// Add additional logic here, if needed
	return reusableLoad(event);
}
```

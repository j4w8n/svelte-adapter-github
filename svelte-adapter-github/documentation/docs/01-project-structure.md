title: Project Structure
---

A typical SvelteKit project looks like this:

```bash
my-project/
├ src/
│ ├ lib/
│ │ ├ server/
│ │ │ └ [your server-only lib files]
│ │ └ [your lib files]
│ ├ params/
│ │ └ [your param matchers]
│ ├ routes/
│ │ └ [your routes]
│ ├ app.html
│ ├ error.html
│ └ hooks.js
├ static/
│ └ [your static assets]
├ tests/
│ └ [your tests]
├ package.json
├ svelte.config.js
├ tsconfig.json
└ vite.config.js
```

You'll also find common files like `.gitignore` and `.npmrc` (and `.prettierrc` and `.eslintrc.cjs` and so on, if you chose those options when running `npm create svelte@latest`).

### Project files

#### src

The `src` directory contains the meat of your project.

- `lib` contains your library code, which can be imported via the [`$lib`](/docs/modules#$lib) alias, or packaged up for distribution using [`svelte-package`](/docs/packaging)
  - `server` contains your server-only library code. It can be imported by using the [`$lib/server`](/docs/server-only-modules) alias. SvelteKit will prevent you from importing these in client code.
- `params` contains any [param matchers](/docs/advanced-routing#matching) your app needs
- `routes` contains the [routes](/docs/routing) of your application
- `app.html` is your page template — an HTML document containing the following placeholders:
  - `%sveltekit.head%` — `<link>` and `<script>` elements needed by the app, plus any `<svelte:head>` content
  - `%sveltekit.body%` — the markup for a rendered page. Typically this lives inside a `<div>` or other element, rather than directly inside `<body>`, to prevent bugs caused by browser extensions injecting elements that are then destroyed by the hydration process
  - `%sveltekit.assets%` — either [`paths.assets`](/docs/configuration#paths), if specified, or a relative path to [`paths.base`](/docs/configuration#paths)
  - `%sveltekit.nonce%` — a [CSP](/docs/configuration#csp) nonce for manually included links and scripts, if used
- `error.html` (optional) is the page that is rendered when everything else fails. It can contain the following placeholders:
  - `%sveltekit.status%` — the HTTP status
  - `%sveltekit.error.message%` — the error message
- `hooks.js` (optional) contains your application's [hooks](/docs/hooks)
- `service-worker.js` (optional) contains your [service worker](/docs/service-workers)

You can use `.ts` files instead of `.js` files, if using TypeScript.

#### static

Any static assets that should be served as-is, like `robots.txt` or `favicon.png`, go in here.

#### tests

If you chose to add tests to your project during `npm create svelte@latest`, they will live in this directory.

#### package.json

Your `package.json` file must include `@sveltejs/kit`, `svelte` and `vite` as `devDependencies`.

When you create a project with `npm create svelte@latest`, you'll also notice that `package.json` includes `"type": "module"`. This means that `.js` files are interpreted as native JavaScript modules with `import` and `export` keywords. Legacy CommonJS files need a `.cjs` file extension.

#### svelte.config.js

This file contains your Svelte and SvelteKit [configuration](/docs/configuration).

#### tsconfig.json

This file (or `jsconfig.json`, if you prefer type-checked `.js` files over `.ts` files) configures TypeScript, if you added typechecking during `npm create svelte@latest`. Since SvelteKit relies on certain configuration being set a specific way, it generates its own `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json` file which your own config `extends`.

#### vite.config.js

A SvelteKit project is really just a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) project that uses the [`@sveltejs/kit/vite`](/docs/modules#sveltejs-kit-vite) plugin, along with any other [Vite configuration](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

### Other files

#### .svelte-kit

As you develop and build your project, SvelteKit will generate files in a `.svelte-kit` directory (configurable as [`outDir`](/docs/configuration#outdir)). You can ignore its contents, and delete them at any time (they will be regenerated when you next `dev` or `build`).
